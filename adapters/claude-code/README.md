# Forseti — Claude Code adapter (v0: safety verify-gate)

A **self-contained** Claude Code plugin that puts ESBMC inside the coding loop as
a *hard gate*. It has **no dependency on the `esbmc-plugin`** and needs no MCP
server — the hooks call the neutral `forseti` CLI directly.

> **Forseti returns a verdict; the harness owns the loop.** The hooks are the
> trigger/gate, Claude is the worker, the `forseti` CLI is the tool. Forseti
> itself never loops — each call verifies once and returns `VERIFIED (up to k) |
> VIOLATED + counterexample | UNKNOWN | ERROR`.

## What it does

- **PostToolUse hook** — after every `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit` of a `.c`/`.h`
  file, it verifies each top-level function defined in that file at the
  **function level** (`esbmc --function <name>`): no `main`, no harness. ESBMC
  havocs the parameters and checks the built-in **safety** properties (memory
  safety, signed overflow, array bounds, division by zero, UB). A non-`VERIFIED`
  verdict is fed straight back to Claude as the counterexample to fix.
- **Stop hook** — blocks the turn from ending while any touched unit is not
  `VERIFIED up to k`. After `MAX_STOP_ATTEMPTS` (3) consecutive blocks with no
  fix, it lets the turn end but with a **loud** unverified residual — never a
  silent pass, never an infinite loop.

Latest verdicts are cached in `.forseti/gate_state.json` (per project,
gitignored). Forseti core stays stateless; the *gate* is what is stateful.

### Scope: v0 = safety, v1 = semantics

A harness is only needed to express a **contract you invented** ("the output is
sorted", "abs(x) ≥ 0"). Language-level **safety** properties are free at the
function level — that is all v0 checks. Generated *semantic* properties (propose
→ render harness → check) are **v1**, not wired here yet.

## Requirements

- `esbmc` on `PATH` (the gate shells out to it via Forseti).
- The `forseti` CLI on `PATH`: from the Forseti repo, `pip install -e .` (the
  hooks fall back to `python -m forseti.core` if the package is importable but
  the script is not on `PATH`).

## Enable it

Hooks load at **session start**, so after either method, **restart Claude Code**
(`claude`), then confirm with `/hooks`.

**As a plugin (recommended, portable):** install this directory as a plugin (via
your marketplace, or point Claude Code at `adapters/claude-code/`). The
`hooks/hooks.json` wires both hooks using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.

**As project settings (no plugin):** add to the target project's
`.claude/settings.json`, replacing `ABS_PATH` with the absolute path to this
directory:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "python3 \"ABS_PATH/hooks/post_tool_use.py\"", "timeout": 120 }] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "python3 \"ABS_PATH/hooks/stop_gate.py\"", "timeout": 120 }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Try the demo

In a C project with the plugin enabled, ask Claude:

> *Implement `int64_t my_abs(int64_t x)` that returns the absolute value, in
> `abs64.c`.*

Claude writes the obvious `(x < 0) ? -x : x`. The PostToolUse hook verifies
`abs64.c::my_abs` and returns **VIOLATED** with the counterexample `x =
INT64_MIN` (`arithmetic overflow on neg`, CWE-190/191). Claude reads it, saturates
`INT64_MIN → INT64_MAX`, and the re-verify returns **VERIFIED up to k**. Only then
does the Stop-gate let the turn end. See
[`docs/walkthroughs/0002-hook-enforced-safety.md`](../../docs/walkthroughs/0002-hook-enforced-safety.md).

## Configuration

| Setting | Where | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Safety flags | `SAFETY_FLAGS` in `hooks/forseti_gate.py` | `--overflow-check` | bounds/pointer/div-by-zero are ESBMC defaults; unsigned-overflow left OFF (legal wraparound) |
| Unwind bound *k* | `FORSETI_UNWIND` env | `1` | a `VERIFIED` is only "up to k"; **loops need a higher k** |
| Verify timeout | `FORSETI_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_S` env | `110` | per-function wall-clock budget |
| Stop-gate attempts | `MAX_STOP_ATTEMPTS` in `forseti_gate.py` | `3` | blocks then lets the turn end with a loud residual |

## Known limitations (v0)

- **Function detection is a regex heuristic**, not a C parser — it finds
  column-0 function *definitions* (prototypes excluded). Unusual formatting
  (return type on its own line, K&R style) may be missed; a false positive
  surfaces as an ERROR verdict rather than a silent skip.
- **No k-escalation.** The gate verifies at one fixed k; an `UNKNOWN` (e.g. a
  loop under-unwound) blocks with guidance to raise `FORSETI_UNWIND`, rather than
  laddering k automatically.
- **Safety only.** Functional correctness beyond the built-in safety checks is
  the v1 semantic-property path.
